        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a
        member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark
        vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator,
        it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is
        territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
        large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey
        and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for
        about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home
        range to establish their own. The tiger was first scientifically
        described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia
        Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south
        from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since
        the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of
        their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central
        Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and
        South Asia and China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam
        free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests
        to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent,
        Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra.

      <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
        Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded
        head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is
        sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
        prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
        lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
        Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
        ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some
        lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt
        humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. The
        lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more
        diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being
        active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion
        ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but
        it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and
        one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the
        IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
        declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
        untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
        decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
        are the greatest causes for concern.

      <p>
        The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and
        Southwest Asia (today restricted to central Iran). It is the fastest
        land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph), as such
        has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build,
        long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in)
        at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m
        (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and
        159 lb). Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black
        tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or
        pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots.
        Four subspecies are recognised. The cheetah lives in three main social
        groups: females and their cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males.
        While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home
        ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller
        territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The
        cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It
        feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88
        lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and
        Thomson's gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey within 60–100
        m (200–330 ft) before charging towards it, trips it during the chase and
        bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the
        year. After a gestation of nearly three months, a litter of typically
        three or four cubs is born. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to
        predation by other large carnivores such as hyenas and lions. They are
        weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of
        age.

      <p>
        The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the only living
        member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. With a body length
        of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 158 kg (348 lb), it is
        the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the
        world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored
        fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although
        a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's
        powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and
        tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly
        through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal
        blow to the brain. The modern jaguar's ancestors probably entered the
        Americas from Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene via the land bridge
        that once spanned the Bering Strait. Today, the jaguar's range extends
        from core Southwestern United States across Mexico and much of Central
        America, the Amazon rainforest and south to Paraguay and northern
        Argentina. It inhabits a variety of forested and open terrains, but its
        preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest,
        wetlands and wooded regions. It is adept at swimming and is largely a
        solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. As a keystone
        species, it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and in
        regulating prey populations.
